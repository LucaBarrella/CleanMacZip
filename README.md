# CleanMacZip

CleanMacZip is a Bash script for macOS that allows you to create ZIP archives free from hidden files generated by macOS (such as `.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX`, and `._*`). These files can be annoying when the ZIP is opened on Windows and Linux systems.

## Features

- Removes automatically generated system files and folders from macOS, cleaning up the archive.
- Supports two languages: Italian and English.
- Allows you to choose a destination directory for the resulting ZIP file.

## Requirements

The script is compatible with Bash 3.x or later versions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** or create a file named `RemoveMacOsJunk.sh` and paste the script.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CleanMacZip.git
   cd CleanMacZip

	2.	Make the script executable:

chmod +x RemoveMacOsJunk.sh


	3.	Run the script:

./RemoveMacOsJunk.sh


	4.	Follow the interactive instructions to:
	•	Choose the language (Italian or English).
	•	Enter the path of the folder to compress.
	•	Decide whether to save the ZIP file in the same directory as the original folder or specify a different directory.

Example Usage

Suppose you have a folder called Project on your desktop. The script will prompt for the folder path, your preferred language, and the save location for the ZIP file.

Example input:

Choose language:
1) Italian
2) English
